Library

The library folder contains a currated collection of drivers copied from various propeller libraries. Rather than binding the original collections only the known working tested libraries are included as a reference. The original libraries should work and will often be used because real world projects will involve mixed virtual and real components. Ideally in the future a standard library mechanism like nuget or similar will be created for propeller libraries.
